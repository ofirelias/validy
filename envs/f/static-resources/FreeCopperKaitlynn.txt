Slept like a log last night  woke up in the fireplace.
Why do birds fly south for the winter? Because it's too far to walk.
Why did the kid cross the playground? To get to the other slide.
What creature is smarter than a talking parrot? A spelling bee.
Why is Peter Pan always flying? Because he Neverlands.
