What did the father tomato say to the baby tomato whilst on a family walk? Ketchup.
I thought my wife was joking when she said she'd leave me if I didn't stop signing "I'm A Believer"... Then I saw her face.
I'm tired of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they are going and meet up with them later.
