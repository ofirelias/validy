What did the father tomato say to the baby tomato whilst on a family walk? Ketchup.
I knew I shouldn't steal a mixer from work, but it was a whisk I was willing to take.
I'm tired of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they are going and meet up with them later.
What did one nut say as he chased another nut?  I'm a cashew!
