What is a centipedes's favorite Beatle song?  I want to hold your hand, hand, hand, hand...
Why was it called the dark ages? Because of all the knights. 
Why didnt the skeleton cross the road? Because he had no guts.
What creature is smarter than a talking parrot? A spelling bee.
Dad Im hungry  Hi hungry Im dad
Slept like a log last night  woke up in the fireplace.
Why is Peter Pan always flying? Because he Neverlands.
Why didnt the skeleton cross the road? Because he had no guts.
