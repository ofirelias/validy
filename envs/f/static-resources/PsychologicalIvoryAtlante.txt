How come the stadium got hot after the game? Because all of the fans left.
Why do birds fly south for the winter? Because it's too far to walk.
Why was it called the dark ages? Because of all the knights. 
What do you call two barracuda fish?  A Pairacuda!
Why does a Moon-rock taste better than an Earth-rock? Because it's a little meteor.
