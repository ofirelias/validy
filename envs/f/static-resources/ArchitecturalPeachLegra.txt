Why did the kid cross the playground? To get to the other slide.
Why was it called the dark ages? Because of all the knights.

To be Frank, I'd have to change my name.
Why didnt the skeleton cross the road? Because he had no guts.
Why did the tomato blush? Because it saw the salad dressing.
What creature is smarter than a talking parrot? A spelling bee.
I'm tired of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they are going and meet up with them later.
