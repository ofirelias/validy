Why is Peter Pan always flying? Because he Neverlands.
How come the stadium got hot after the game? Because all of the fans left.
What do you call two barracuda fish?  A Pairacuda!
Did you know that protons have mass? I didn't even know they were catholic.
Why did the tomato blush? Because it saw the salad dressing.
Chances are if you' ve seen one shopping center, you've seen a mall.
